### Project Description <a name="projectdescription"></a>
This program would allow students to interact with the anesthesia and see results in the simulated patient. For example, delivering a drug, increasing anesthetic gas, or delivering a fluid bolus. Patient parameters {heart rate (HR)}, respiratory rate (RR), capnography (ETCO2), temperature (temp), ECG, pulse – oximetry (SPO2), blood pressures – systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP respectively) will change based off student choices. 

This program will allow students to understand anesthetic monitoring without having the pressure of a live patient and will also allow them to practice anesthetic interventions, so they feel more prepared for them in a clinical setting. If this program is very successful it could become a wonderful training tool for students and industry professionals alike.
